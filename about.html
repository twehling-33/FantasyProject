        <h1>About Fantasy Futures</h1>

        <p>
            Fantasy Futures is a fantasy football analytics site developed for our project to demonstrate
            web development skills using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. The goal of the project was to build a fully functioning
            website that could analyze NFL performance data and provide users with tools such as player search,
            trade evaluation, and start/sit decision support. The final product integrates a database, several
            interactive PHP-driven pages, and an easy to navigate layout accessible through the site’s main navigation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The layout of the site was designed to be clean, consistent, and intuitive. Every page begins with a shared
            header displaying the application title and a navigation bar linking to the Home, Player Search, Trade Analyzer,
            Start/Sit, About, and Contact pages. This creates a uniform experience where visitors always know how to move
            between sections of the site.
        </p>

        <p>
            A significant part of the project involved designing and integrating a remote MySQL database hosted by TinkerHost.
            The database stores all statistical information used across the site, including weekly player performance for the
            entire 2024 NFL season. The original data came in the form of eighteen separate CSV files—one for each week. These
            files were cleaned, merged, and imported into a single database table called PlayerStats, which
            contains player names, IDs, teams, opponents, weekly stats, and calculated totals such as total yards and
            touchdowns. Consolidating the weekly data into one table greatly simplified our SQL queries and prevented the
            codebase from becoming unnecessarily complex. A secondary table was later added that contained player projected
            fantasy points to add the post-trade player performance chart.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each feature of the site uses this database in a different way. The Player Search page allows users to filter by
            name, week, team, or position, building SQL queries based on whichever filters the user selects.
            The Trade Analyzer is more calculation-focused: users enter two groups of players, and the application computes
            fantasy values using PPR scoring formulas applied to real weekly data. The tool then totals both sides and
            identifies which group of players provides more expected value based off previous performance and offers
            insight to potential future performance via a plot of projected future performance for all parties in the trade.
            The Start/Sit tool serves as a quicker comparative feature, helping users evaluate two players head-to-head
            based on their historical weekly output. Together, these tools demonstrate how a well-structured
            database can support multiple forms of analysis when paired with PHP programming.
        </p>

        <p>
            Building this website required integrating front-end design, server-side scripting, and database queries into one
            functioning system. The development process began with basic HTML structure, then expanded into shared styling,
            and finally into server-side PHP for database-driven functionality. Deployment was handled through TinkerHost using
            PhpStorm’s built-in tools. The project showcases the complete pipeline of web development—from planning and data
            preparation to coding, debugging, database design, and live deployment. By combining these components, Fantasy
            Futures operates as both a functional fantasy football toolkit and a practical demonstration of full-stack
            development skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout the development of this project, we also made use of a large language model (ChatGPT) as a supplemental
            development tool. The model was particularly useful during the initial setup of the website structure, where it
            provided guidance on organizing files, establishing navigation patterns, and configuring PHP–MySQL connections.
            As we progressed, the model helped troubleshoot issues related to database queries, broken links, PHP errors,
            and formatting. Using the model accelerated problem-solving and helped us better understand the underlying
            concepts behind our code and hosting environment.
